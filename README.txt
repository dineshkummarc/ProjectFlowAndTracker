The all new ProjectFlowAndTracker Chicago based on Panels Everywhere and OG
PFT is bootstrapping itself, being used for its own creation, and will be usable soon.
You need to be logged in as teammember1 to see anything, since there are no public projects yet. With first release on staging, however, PFT will have a public project visible and accessible to all.
Once it is, even minimally, it will be online as a service. There will always be a usable version free as in beer, speech and the workplace (should be). Source always under GPL. Aan installation profile on drupal.org is planned.
If you are one of the more than one hundred good folks been exploring http://projectflowandtracker.com up till now, you will already have an account when this happens.
